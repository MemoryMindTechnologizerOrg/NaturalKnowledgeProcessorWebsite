<div><p id="PONE">Natural Knowledge Processing to known unknown trajectories would have to be programmed
    with human data sets to answers and questions and using turned in to human readable text all the results
    from human data set interviews. Naturally ran through a processor of servers or just basic 2 core gold processor
    a data readable in human theory or eye sight would then gain attention to the factors of answering the unknown.
    for instance when this is programmed and tested it may not be right all the time. When you ask the question "How did 
    Humans start creation of earth?" or "How did the galaxy form?" the Natural Knowledge processor would then go through a 
    computational statistically strengthen model</p>

<p id="PTHREE">Here is a code you might like to take into your knowledge calculating the trajectory of a number of #InitialVelocity
    acceleration of gravity and time of velocity travelling through gravity it goes like
    velocity multiplied by time subtract 0.5 multiplied by gravity multiplied by time 
    to the power of 2! I just learned that mathematical solution well reading a python study book!
</p>
<P id="PFOUR">Does the acceleration change by scale of height in proportionate height from seal level?
     does gravity get heavier below sea level, does gravity change with snow or temperatures. I believe everyone has a center of individuality on there gravity in certain situations and places being</P>
